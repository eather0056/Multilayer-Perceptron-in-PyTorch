# Multilayer Perceptron in PyTorch

Welcome to the "Multilayer Perceptron in PyTorch" repository! This project serves as a practical introduction to PyTorch (PT) for working on an artificial classification problem. It was completed as part of the coursework at the University de Toulon under the guidance of Professor R. Marxer Pau.

## Introduction

### Goal
The primary goal of this project is to familiarize ourselves with the basics of PyTorch while tackling an artificial classification problem.

### Plan
In this tutorial, we will follow these steps:

1. **Data Generation**: Create synthetic data to serve as our example problem.
2. **MLP Model**: Implement a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model in PyTorch.
3. **Training**: Train the MLP model to learn its parameters from the synthetic data.
4. **Visualization**: Visualize various learning measures and the parameters of the trained model.

Additionally, we have the following sections:

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: In a second part, we will modify our data and adapt the hyperparameters (e.g., number of hidden neurons) of our model to improve classification performance.

- **Understanding PyTorch**: In another section, we will explore the fundamental functions of PyTorch to gain insight into our process and how PyTorch operates. We will also highlight the high-level features and aids of PyTorch that simplify our tasks.
